# market-simulation-rl-agents
This project simulates a financial market with reinforcement learning agents making investment decisions. Agents use neural networks to make these decisions. Their actions, combined with Brownian motion, influence market prices. The simulation visualizes market price changes, agent balances, and balance distribution in real-time.
